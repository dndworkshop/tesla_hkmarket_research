<h2>This project we analysis Tesla how to enlarge the EV market in Hong Kong</h2> <br>
<li>We collect the data from different resource (incl. Consumer Council, Transport Department, University of Oxford - CO2 emission data and the interview of real EV users</li></br>

<h2>Entire process we utilize google drive to storage the data set and process it with Beautiful Soup</h2><br>
  <li>After we collected the data we clear all the null value and delete irrelavant data</li></br>

<h2>Introduction of EV market</h2>

<br>  
<h2>Utilize the data to show why Gasoline / Oil Car would be replace by EV </h2>
  <li>We found that 0 CO2 generation would be the global trend according to the Pairs Agreement</li>
  <li>According to the data from University of Oxford member countries are moving along the goal</li></br>

  <h2>Global Price of Crude oil trigger the driver move their choice to EV</h2>
  <li>Recently the crude oil price increase significantly by the war of Ukraine and Russia</li>
  <li>Driving cost will make driver bear a hudge burden,so move to EV </li>
  <li>When oil price go up wil benefit the sale volume of EV</li>
  <li>Thorugh out the data showed ,we recognize that the driver is really sensitive to the oil price movement</li>
  <li>Driver (Consumer) response the oil price in sync which also convery the buyer behaviour </li>
  <li>Aginst to this feature we can grant incentive to this type of potential consumer </li></br>

  <h2>Shifting focus on Commercial Car Market</h2>
  <li>Private Car will be a mature market</li>
  <li>Set China as an example ,we saw EV taxi all around the country</li>  
  <li>The development still lag behind in this sector</li></br>

  <h2>How can we make it more common</h2>
  <h3>Infrastructure</h3>
  <li>Powrful vested interests would be a learning model</li>
  <li>Network Establishment should be utilize the concept of Gasoline network building </li>

   <h3>Quality of Infrastructure</h3>
   <li>Number of Charging Port not enough for the driver </li>
   <li>Huge Difference on different type of Charing Port</li>
   <li>Lack of Quick Charging Port</li>
